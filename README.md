# 🚀 Interactive Online Store (Replit-ready)

## 📦 What’s Included

This project includes **EVERYTHING** you need to run a **basic functional online store**:

✅ Node.js Express backend (`server.js`)
✅ SQLite3 database — creates `products`, `orders`, `order_items` tables automatically
✅ API routes:
   - `/api/products` (GET, POST)
   - `/api/orders` (POST)
✅ Admin page (`/admin`) to add products
✅ Product catalog (`/`) with dynamic product listing
✅ Shopping cart (`/cart`) using LocalStorage
✅ Checkout page (`/checkout`) — saves order in database
✅ Clean static frontend — HTML, CSS, JS in `/public`
✅ `.replit` — auto install & run
✅ `package.json` — defines dependencies
✅ **README.md** — this file, explains everything

## ✅ How to Run on Replit

1. Create a new **Node.js Replit**.
2. Upload all project files (`server.js`, `package.json`, `.replit`, `public/` folder).
3. Click **Run** — Replit will install everything and start the server.
4. Visit the URL — your store is live!

## 🗂️ Pages

- `/` → Home page with product catalog
- `/cart` → Shopping cart
- `/checkout` → Place an order
- `/admin` → Add new products

## ✅ How to Use

1. Visit `/admin` → Add products.
2. Browse the catalog (`/`) → Click "Add to Cart".
3. Go to `/cart` → See what’s in your cart.
4. Click **Checkout** → Fill in your name/email → Place order.
5. Order is saved in the database (`orders` + `order_items`).

## ⚠️ What’s NOT Included (yet)

❌ No payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal) — you can integrate this later.
❌ No user login/account system — you can add this if needed.
❌ No product image upload to server (uses URLs only).
❌ No advanced admin dashboard (edit/delete products) — you can extend it.

## 💡 How to Extend

- Add Stripe or PayPal to accept real payments.
- Add login/registration for customers.
- Add product editing & deletion.
- Improve the front-end with a framework (React, Vue, Svelte).
